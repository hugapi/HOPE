## Introduction

Inspired by [PEP 20 - The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/), we've written down some guiding principals for Hug development.

## The Zen of Hug

```
Simple Things should be easy, complex things should be possible.
Complex things done often should be made simple.

Magic should be avoided.
Magic isn't magic as soon as its mechanics are universally understood.

Wrong documentation is worse than no documentation.
Everything should be documented.

All code should be tested.
All tests should be meaningful.

Consistency is more important than perfection.
It's okay to break consistency for practicality.

Clarity is more important than performance.
If we do our job right, there shouldn't need to be a choice.

Interfaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```

## Easter Egg

```
>> from hug import this
```
