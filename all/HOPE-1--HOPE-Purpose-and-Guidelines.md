## What is a HOPE?

HOPE stands for Hug Official Proposal for Enhancement. A HOPE is a design document providing information to the Hug community, or describing a new feature for Hug or its processes or environment. The HOPE should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

We intend HOPEs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Hug. The HOPE author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

Because HOPEs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

HOPEs are modeled directly after [Python PEPs](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/), the language that powers Hug.
