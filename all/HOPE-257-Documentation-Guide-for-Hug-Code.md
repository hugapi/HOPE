## Introduction

This document gives documentation conventions for the Hug code comprising the Hug core as well as all official interfaces, extensions, and plugins for the framework.
Optionally, projects that use Hug are encouraged to follow this HOPE and link to it as a reference.

From the [Zen of Hug](https://github.com/hugapi/HOPE/blob/master/all/HOPE-20--The-Zen-of-Hug.md):

```
    Wrong documentation is worse than no documentation.
    Everything should be documented.
```

To this aim, Hug projects should contain extensive automated low-level documentation as well as maintained high-level documentation.

## PEP 257 Docstring conventions

All doc string based should follow Python's [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) docstring conventions.

## Minimal Documentation

Any code intended for external use should be documented with a docstring, at every level:
    - Module
    - Class
    - Function
    - Method
    - Etc

Type annotations should be used heavily were able to define acceptable parameters.
These annotations should be enforced using `MyPy`.
Any documentation that can be made via Type Annotations should be made there and not repeated within docstrings.
Where possible, high-level documentation should be added to module docstrings and where applicable via HOPE documents themselves.
Any module that is a direct implementation of a HOPE should link back to the HOPE for reference.

## Documentation Markup

If any markup is needed to express a documentation concept fully, that markup should be added via the
[Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) standard.
Markdown can be placed within docstrings and into stand-alone `.md` files within the project.

## Generating Browsable Documentation

All projects should generate web browsable documentation, exposed via GitPages or similar service.
This documentation can be auto-generated using [pdoc](https://pdoc3.github.io/pdoc/) or similar.
